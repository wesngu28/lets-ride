    On March 16th 2022, the Seattle Seahawks traded franchise legend and decade-long
    starting qb Russell Wilson to the Denver Broncos. This came on the heels of reports of
    friction between Russell and the staff, as well as the general aura and feeling of
    Russ just wanting out.

    At the time, this was seen as an absolute steal for Denver, setting them up with their
    answer at the quarterback position and vaulting them up to Super Bowl contenders,
    while sending the Seahawks to a rebuilding phase and losing seasons under journeyman
    backup Geno Smith.
