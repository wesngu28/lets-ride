# Russ Trade Dashboard

A quick little dashboard I made to display some of the relevant information regarding the Russell Wilson Seattle Seahawks to Denver trade, showing Russ's current stats on the season and his previous game, the same listed stats for Geno, as well as their team records, the projected pick that Seattle got from Denver, and a small write-up of the trade details.

## Hosting

If you want to host this for some reason, clone the repo and then run

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
I made this using SvelteKit and this is my second project with Svelte. The content is fetched from ESPN and auto-fetches once a day or on build. I started with using sass but switched to tailwind during development. The photos were taken from various sources and I do not claim to own them. I am not a Broncos fan.
